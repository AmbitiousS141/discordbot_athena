I'm proud to present to you... TreeHuggr! 
They say little actions can build up to change big things. TreeHuggr aims to inspire change through its regular messages and reactions related to the environment. Quotes and tips are provided on command, and positive reactions are added when server members react emojis of plants. To test it out:
try typing in "!tip" or "!quote"
try reacting a plant emoji to a message!

By integrating small reminders in our daily lives, we can influence mindsets to strive for change.

AnnoyBot is the component of this bot that retaliates to various emojis. Essentially, one of the servers I'm in has at least three custom emojis of me. They're the top emojis, and I'm not chronically online enough to make sure that opps' custom emojis are keeping up. AnnoyBot can do that in my place! This component doesn't affect servers where it's added for TreeHuggr as AnnoyBot reacts to custom emojis that don't exist in all servers.

I'm not entirely new to Python - I took a course on it... 5 years ago. Coding this bot refreshed my veeeeeeeeeery dusty memory, from syntax to logic. To get an idea of it, I typed =/= instead of != at some point - and then scrapped that part entirely, as there was a logic error with my original loop. Other concepts I refreshed with this project are the addition assignment operator, the len() function, f-strings, and naming conventions. It might be just over 100 lines of code, but I'm proud of myself for getting back into this and recalling what I learned in the past :D. 

Someone once told me they didn't think I was able to code a Discord bot. Haha, I guess this bot's existence will annoy them more than its functionality.

Thanks for reading :D
