I'm proud to present to you...
AnnoyBot, a public Discord bot that retaliates to various emojis.

Essentially, one of the servers I'm in has at least three custom emojis of me. They're the top emojis, and I'm not chronically online enough to make sure that opps' custom emojis are keeping up. AnnoyBot can do that in my place!

I'm not entirely new to Python - I took a course on it... 5 years ago. Coding this bot refreshed my veeeeeeeeeery dusty memory, from syntax to logic. To get an idea of it, I typed =/= instead of != at some point - and then scrapped that part entirely, as there was a logic error with my original loop. Other concepts I refreshed with this project are the addition assignment operator, the len() function, f-strings, and naming conventions. It might be just over 50 lines of code, but I'm proud of myself for getting back into this and recalling what I learned in the past :D. 

Someone once told me they didn't think I was able to code a Discord bot. Haha, I guess this bot's existence will annoy them more than its functionality.

Thanks for reading :D
